            <h1>Exploring Forms in Angular – types, benefits and differences </h1>
            <h2>Template-Driven Forms  <br>
                Model-Driven Forms, also known as Reactive Forms  </h2>
            <h4>Both are highly coupled with the framework and thus extremely viable; they both belong to the @angular/forms library and share a common set of form control classes. However, they also have their own specific sets of features, along with their pros and cons, which could ultimately lead to us choosing one of them.  
<br>
                Let’s try to quickly summarize these differences.  </h4>

                <h2>Template-Driven Forms </h2>
                <h4> 
If you’ve come from AngularJS, there’s a high chance that the Template-Driven approach will ring a bell or two. As the name implies, Template-Driven Forms host most of the logic in the template code; working with a Template-Driven Form means:  
<br>
Building the form in the .html template file  <br>
Binding data to the various input fields using ngModel instance  <br>
Using a dedicated ngForm object related to the whole form and containing all the inputs, with each being accessible through their name.<br>  
These things need to be done to perform the required validity checks. To understand this, here’s what a Template-Driven Form looks like:<br>
Here, we can access any element, including the form itself, with some convenient aliases – the attributes with the # sign – and check for their current states to create our own validation workflow.  <br>

These states are provided by the framework and will change in real-time, depending on various things: touched, for example, becomes True when the control has been visited at least once; dirty, which is the opposite of pristine, means that the control value has changed, and so on. We used both touched and dirty in the preceding example because we want our validation message to only be shown if the user moves their focus to the and then goes away, leaving it blank by either deleting its value or not setting it.  <br>

These are Template-Driven Forms in a nutshell; now that we’ve had an overall look at them, let’s try to summarize the pros and cons of this approach. Here are the main advantages of Template-Driven Forms:  <br>
Template-Driven Forms are very easy to write. We can recycle most of our HTML knowledge (assuming that we have any). On top of that, if we come from AngularJS, we already know how well we can make them work once we’ve mastered the technique.  <br>
They are rather easy to read and understand, at least from an HTML point of view; we have a plain, understandable HTML structure containing all the input fields and validators, one after another. Each element will have a name, a two-way binding with the underlying ngModel, and (possibly) Template-Driven logic built upon aliases that have been hooked to other elements that we can also see, or to the form itself.  <br>
Here are their weaknesses:  <br>

Template-Driven Forms require a lot of HTML code, which can be rather difficult to maintain and is generally more error-prone than pure TypeScript.  <br>
For the same reason, these forms cannot be unit tested. We have no way to test their validators or to ensure that the logic we implemented will work, other than running an end-to-end test with our browser, which is hardly ideal for complex forms.  <br>
Their readability will quickly drop as we add more and more validators and input tags. Keeping all their logic within the template might be fine for small forms, but it does not scale well when dealing with complex data items.<br>
