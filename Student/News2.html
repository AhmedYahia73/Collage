            <h1>Understanding the Foundation of Protocol-oriented Design</h1>
            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            <h4>When we develop applications, we usually have a set of requirements that we need to develop against. With that in mind, let’s define the requirements for the animal types that we will be creating in this article:
<br>
                We will have three categories of animals: land, sea, and air.<br>
                Animals may be members of multiple categories. For example, an alligator can be a member of both the land and sea categories.<br>
                Animals may attack and/or move when they are on a tile that matches the categories they are in.<br>
                Animals will start off with a certain number of hit points, and if those hit points reach 0 or less, then they will be considered dead.</h4>
                <h2>POP Design</h2>
                <h4>
                    We will start off by looking at how we would design the animal types needed and the relationships between them. <br>

In this design, we use three techniques: protocol inheritance, protocol composition, and protocol extensions.
                </h4>
             <h2>  Protocol inheritance</h2>
             <h4>
                Protocol inheritance is where one protocol can inherit the requirements from one or more additional protocols. We can also inherit requirements from multiple protocols, whereas a class in Swift can have only one superclass.<br>
                
                Protocol inheritance is extremely powerful because we can define several smaller protocols and mix/match them to create larger protocols. You will want to be careful not to create protocols that are too granular because they will become hard to maintain and manage.
            </h4> 
          <h2> Protocol composition</h2> <h4>
Protocol composition allows types to conform to more than one protocol. With protocol-oriented design, we are encouraged to create multiple smaller protocols with very specific requirements. Let’s look at how protocol composition works.<br>

Protocol inheritance and composition are really powerful features but can also cause problems if used wrongly.<br>

Protocol composition and inheritance may not seem that powerful on their own; however, when we combine them with protocol extensions, we have a very powerful programming paradigm. Let’s look at how powerful this paradigm is.
