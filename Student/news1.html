            <h1>Clean Coding in Python with Mariano Anaya</h1>
            <h2>Key-takeaways:</h2>
            <h4>Clean code isn’t just a nice thing to have or a luxury in software projects; it’s a necessity.<br>
                If we want our project to successfully deliver features constantly at a steady and predictable pace, then having a good and maintainable code base is a must.<br>
                The true nature of clean code rely on the fact that other practitioners should be
                able to read and maintain the code.<br>
                Read the book Clean Code in Python, Second Edition, to know all about idiomatic Python, see the difference between good and bad code, and identify traits of good code and good architecture.<br>
                There is no sole or strict definition of clean code. Moreover, there is probably no way of formally measuring clean code, so you cannot run a tool on a repository that will tell you how good, bad, or maintainable that code is. Sure, you can run tools such as checkers, linters, static analyzers, and so on, and those tools are of much help. They are necessary, but not sufficient. Clean code is not something a machine or script can recognize (so far) but rather something that professionals can decide.<br>
                
                We interviewed Python expert, and bestselling author, Mariano Anaya on clean coding, importance of efficient code formatting and his recent book, Clean Code in Python, 2nd Edition.</h4>
                <h2>The interview in detail:</h2>
                <h3>o what extent can the inability to write efficient code harm/affect an organization/software?</h3>
                <h4>In my experience, inefficient code can be so dangerous as to paralyze entire projects. I’ve seen services that needed to be re-written because of how unmaintainable they were. At some point, it became impossible to keep on making changes to that API, and the issues kept piling up, so it needed to be replaced by a brand-new system. 

                    On another occasion, there was an application we knew had problems because of the way it was written, and its instability was causing frustration in customers, which permeated into the company. The buggy nature of the application wasn’t separate from the way it was written, rather it was the consequence. Customers were complaining about quality, and this shows up to which degree technical debt can harm an organization. I’ve seen this pattern several times, when the company must make the hard decision of stopping the release of new features to fix errors in the software.</h4>
       <h3> What should developers keep in mind while starting out with legacy systems?</h3>
       <h4>First to identify the degree of technical debt accrued. There are good software projects that have been designed correctly and their technical debt is relatively low (perhaps it’s just about updating some libraries to newer versions or moving parts of the code towards new features that weren’t available at the time it was originally written). <br>

        In the event of having a lot of technical debt, it’s important to understand what’s the most critical part that needs to be fixed. There’s certainly a part in the code, a module, or a functionality that’s responsible for most of the complaints from customers, and that’s what needs to be refactored more urgently. <br>
        
        It’s critical in this sense to do a proper analysis and have a plan about the improvements to make in the code, rather than jump straight to the code and start refactoring. This will help give a clearer idea of what needs to be changed, and the degree of the refactor needed. Meaning, if we’ll be fixing the code, or the situation requires a full rewrite. Generally, completely rewritten the application should be a last-resort kind of decision, although there are some obvious cases (for example, if the application was written with Python 2, then it’s clear that all the code will need to be changed).</h4>
